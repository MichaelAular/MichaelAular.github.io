  "bio": "Hi! My name is Michael and for quite some time now there are two things I love to do in my life. The first one is bouldering, the second is coding. Both have changed me drastically and between them there I find a similarity that defines me. Not even that long ago I was, as a Commercial Manager for a production house with several commercial TV productions, responsible for all commercial aspects that are involved in such a production. However, after years of being commercially successful,  I found that I preferred to focus on production instead of sales and was no longer happy with my work. Eventually I decided that it was time for a career change and I went back to school to become a Front-end Web Developer. Here I learned to work with JavaScript, React, HTM5, CSS and SAS. Compared to fellow students, I pick up new languages quickly and feel challenged rather than defeated if something doesn't work right away. It may have taken many hours, had ups and downs and resulted in frustration or, with the desired result, euphoria, but with hard work I can now finally call myself Front-end Developer. The past few years have been a long climb that I have not regretted a single day! When I started my studies, I started bouldering at the same time; indoor climbing on a wall up to about four meters, without a rope. It is a workout that is very similar to the development I go through as a Web developer. I see every obstacle as a new challenge in which it is often first a puzzle to find the right path, but sometimes it is just a matter of tackling very hard and making progress. I learn from other people with experience, but I am not afraid to find my own path when needed. For both climbing and coding I listen to the advice of experienced people but in the end I have to do it myself. As soon as I master something new there is a feeling of euphoria. Just a little while... because after that I'm already looking forward to the next climb."
